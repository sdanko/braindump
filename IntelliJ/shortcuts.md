## Quick View

If you’re reading a test you’ve written and you want to quickly view the definition of a 
method, just place the cursor on the method name and press **Ctrl+Shift+I**.
This way you don’t have to navigate to another class to read the code you’re interested in. 
You can apply this to view the definition of classes, methods, or any other entities. 
The name of this feature is Quick Definition. 

## Scroll without moving the cursor position
