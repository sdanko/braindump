## Azure Advisor

When you're in the Azure portal, the Advisor dashboard displays personalized recommendations for all your subscriptions. You can use filters to select recommendations for specific subscriptions, resource groups, or services. The recommendations are divided into five categories:
- Reliability is used to ensure and improve the continuity of your business-critical applications.
- Security is used to detect threats and vulnerabilities that might lead to security breaches.
- Performance is used to improve the speed of your applications.
- Operational Excellence is used to help you achieve process and workflow efficiency, resource manageability, and deployment best practices.
- Cost is used to optimize and reduce your overall Azure spending.
