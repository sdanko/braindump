# Logarithm

This statement: 

```
logb(n) = y
```

is true if:

```
b^y = n
```

In computer science you always deal with logarithm of base 2.

```
log(1) = 0
log(2) = 1
log(4) = 2
log(8) = 3
log(16) = 4
log(32) = 5
log(64) = 6
```

From the following examples you can see that when you double the value of `n`, the value of `log` only
increases by 1. This is important to understand when log complexity is used in Big O notation.

You can see usage of log complexity in searching and sorting algorithms.
