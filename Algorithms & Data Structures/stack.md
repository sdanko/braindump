# Stack

Stack is a list of elements that are in some order, and this list is following the 
Last In First Out principle. Can be implemented with array.

## Operations

- Pop: delete the last item. Complexity is O(1).
- Peek: return the top most item. Complexity is O(1).
- Push: add any item at the last position. O(1) in average case and O(n) in worth case scenario(when working with dynamic arrays).
