# Shared responsibility and types of service

On premises, we are responsible for all the layers of the application.

On the cloud, when using IaaS, responsibility for the infrastructure is on Azure.
Responsibility for the application layer and the data is on the customer.

When using PaaS, Azure is responsible for everything except the application and the data.

SaaS is offering the business function as well.
