# German Cases 

The four German cases are nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive.
- The nominative case is used for sentence subjects. The subject is the person or thing that does the action. For example, in the sentence, “the girl kicks the ball”, “the girl” is the subject. 
- The accusative case is for direct objects. The direct object is the person or thing that receives the action. So in “the girl kicks the ball”, “the ball” is the direct object. 
- The dative case is for indirect objects. The indirect object is the person or thing who “gets” the direct object. So in the sentence “The girl kicks the ball to the boy”, “the boy” is the indirect object. 
- The genitive case is used to express possession. In English, we show possession with an apostrophe + s “the girl's ball”.

## The Nominative Case (Der Nominativ)

|         | **Masculine** | **Feminine** | **Neuter** | **Plural** |
|---------|---------------|--------------|------------|------------|
| **THE** | der           | die          | das        | die        |
| **A**   | ein           | eine         | ein        |            |

The nominative case answers the question, **“wer?”** or **“who?”** 

In both German and English, the nominative case describes the subject of a sentence. Masculine, feminine, and neuter articles appear as follows:
- **Die (Eine) Frau** lebt in Deutschland. (The (a) woman lives in Germany.) In this example, Die Frau, or the woman, is the subject of the sentence.
- **Der (Ein) Mann** arbeitet in der Bäckerei. (The (a) man works in the bakery.) The man is the subject of this sentence and takes the nominative case.
- **Das (Ein) Kind** geht in die Schule. (The (a) child goes to school.) The subject, the child, takes the nominative case.

## The Accusative Case (Der Akkusativ)

|         | **Masculine** | **Feminine** | **Neuter** | **Plural** |
|---------|---------------|--------------|------------|------------|
| **THE** | den           | die          | das        | die        |
| **A**   | einen         | eine         | ein        |            |

The accusative case, known as the objective case in English, answers the question **“wen?”** or **“whom?”** and describes the direct object of a sentence.

Only the masculine articles change in the accusative case. Let's look at a few simple examples:
- Das Kind isst **einen Apfel**. (The child eats an apple). In this sentence, einen Apfel is the direct object in the accusative case. Das Kind is the subject and takes the nominative case.
- Der Mann liebt **die Frau**. (The man loves the woman). Here, die Frau is the direct object in the accusative case. Der Mann is the subject in the nominative case.
- Die Frau liebt **den Mann**. (The woman loves the man). Den Mann is the direct object in this sentence and takes the accusative case. Die Frau is the subject and takes the nominative case.

There are also a few prepositions that always take the accusative case:
- durch (through)
- bis (until)
- für (for)
- ohne (without)
- entlang (along)
- gegen (against)
- um (around)

## The Dative Case (Der Dativ)

|         | **Masculine** | **Feminine** | **Neuter** | **Plural** |
|---------|---------------|--------------|------------|------------|
| **THE** | dem           | der          | dem        | den        |
| **A**   | einem         | einer        | einem      |            |


The dative case describes the indirect object of a sentence in German and English and answers the question, “wem?” (whom), or “was?” (what).

Typically, we use the dative case for indirect objects, which usually receive an action from the direct object (in the accusative case). As with the other cases, word order is flexible, as long as you use the correct case. For example:
- Ich (subject) schenke dir (dative indirect object) eine Blume (accusative direct object).
- Eine Blume (accusative direct object) schenke ich (subject) dir (dative indirect object).
- I'm (subject) giving you (indirect object) a flower (direct object).

Several prepositions take the dative case:
- aus (out)
- auβer (besides)
- bei (next to)
- mit (with)
- nach (after)
- seit (since)
- von (from)
- zu (to)
- gegenüber (opposite)

And some German verbs always take the dative case. These verbs are:
- antworten (to answer)
- danken (to thank)
- glauben (to believe)
- helfen (to help)
- gehören (belong to) 
- gefallen (to like) 

## The Genitive Case (Der Genitiv)

|         | **Masculine** | **Feminine** | **Neuter** | **Plural** |
|---------|---------------|--------------|------------|------------|
| **THE** | des           | der          | des        | der        |
| **A**   | eines         | einer        | eines      |            |

The genitive case indicates possession and answers the question “wessen?” or “whose?”  You'll see the genitive case most often in written German. In spoken German, you'll hear von (from)and the dative case instead of the genitive case.

For example:
- Das Haus meines Vaters (My father's house). The genitive case is common in written German.
- Das Haus von meinem Vater (My father's house). The dative case often replaces the genitive case in spoken German.

The masculine and neuter forms require either an -s or -es ending. Single syllable words take an -es ending, while words with multiple syllables take an -s ending. Here are a few examples.
- Der Koffer des Mannes (The man's suitcase)
- Die Spielzeuge des Kindes (The child's toys)
- Das Buch meines Bruders (My brother's book)
- Das Auto meiner Schwester (My sister's car)

Just as the dative case, certain prepositions always take the genitive case:
- anstatt (instead of)
- außerhalb (outside of)
- innerhalb (inside of)
- trotz (despite)
- während (during)
- wegen (because of)

But in spoken German, Germans sometimes use the dative case with these genitive prepositions.
