## Scroll without moving the cursor position

Often you want to scroll the editor pane up or down to read code. If you don’t need to edit the code, you might not need to move your cursor from its current location.
Use **Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down (or ⌘Up/ ⌘Down)** in your editor pane to scroll it without changing the cursor position.

## Live templates

Use live templates to insert common constructs into your code, such as loops, 
conditions, various declarations, or print statements.

To expand a code snippet, type the corresponding template abbreviation and press **Tab**.

- **Ctrl + J**: List of live templates available in the current context.

## Postfix completion

Postfix code completion lets you add template code around an expression you’ve just typed. 
A template expands when you type its abbreviation (postfix) after a dot and press the expansion key
(**Tab** by default) or when you select the abbreviation in the code completion popup.
For example, the `.if` postfix applied to an expression wraps it with an if statement.

To see a full list of postfix abbreviations for your code, type "." (dot) and press the "up" arrow 
on the dropdown list of suggestions.
