# Demonstrative pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns are used to highlight something that was previously mentioned or that is clear from the context.

Demonstrative pronouns “demonstrate” something; using them is the verbal equivalent of pointing at something or someone. They draw attention to the thing or person you’re referring to.

Articles **der**, **die**, **das** can also be used as demonstrative pronouns. 
In that case they are always at the beginning of the sentence and they cant be translated with `the`.
They are used to avoid repeating the noun be replacing it.

Examples:
- Q: Wo ist das Geld?
- A: Das haben die dieber.
