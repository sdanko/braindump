# Costs in Azure and Optimization

The cost of resource is defined by:
- Type of resource
- Resource SKU
- Resource tier
- Location
- Licensing

## Reservations

If you commit to use some resource of a specific amount of time, you get a discount.

## Hybrid Use Benefit

When you already have licensing on premise.

## Azure Spot VMs

When creating a resource you have an option of using Azure Spot Instance. This makes sense if you are using
some workload that can be stopped. You get cheaper prices because you can get evicted from resource by customers
who pay the regular price.
